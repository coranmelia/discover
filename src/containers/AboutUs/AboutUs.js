                                    This year, the COVID-19 pandemic started 2 months after the beginning of our capstone project.
                                    Ever since then, we had to work remotely, and it was not an easy time for us.
                                    We had to adapt to a variety of "remote" tools that certainly cannot replace human-to-human interactions.
                                    We faced lots of challenges and stresses.
                                    I'm glad that we still made it through and produced a satisfactory outcome.
                                </p>
